# Running models

Running your models is simple, all you need to do is execute the `ezt run` command from the command line when inside your project directory where your `ezt_project.yml` is located. This will execute all of your models that you have created inside your project.

Check out the [CLI reference](/pages/reference/cli_ref/) in order to learn about the options you can use with the `ezt run` command.
